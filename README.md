# Hitoshi-guitars

Hitoshi guitars is a fictional guitar retailer website. The frontend was made with React and Next JS, while the backend uses Express JS and Mongoose.
The articles' data is stored on a database (MongoDB).

The website allows the user to search through the articles (by typing a keyword such as a brand, a category, or a model), then browse the results, sort them by popularity, brand or price, and add them to their cart.
Hitoshi-guitars uses redux-persist, meaning the cart items will remain within local storage.
